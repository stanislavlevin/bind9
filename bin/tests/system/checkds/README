The test setup for the checkds tests.

These servers are parent servers:
- ns2 is a primary authoritative server that serves the parent zone for zones
  configured in ns9.
- ns4 is the secondary server for ns2.
- ns5 is a primary authoritative server that serves the parent zone for zones
  configured in ns9, but this one does not publish DS records (to test cases
  where the DS is missing).
- ns6 is an authoritative server for a different zone, to test badly configured
  parental agents.
- ns7 is the secondary server for ns5.

Finally, ns9 is the authoritative server for the various DNSSEC enabled test
domains.
