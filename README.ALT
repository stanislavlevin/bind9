By default, named is configured to run in readonly chroot jail with no
extra privileges.

To configure named as master or caching-only DNS, you don't need to create
files and/or directories writable by named.

To configure named as slave DNS in chroot jail,
use control(8) for the bind-slave facility.

To debug named with rndc(8),
use control(8) for the bind-debug facility.
