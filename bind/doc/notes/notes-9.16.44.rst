Notes for BIND 9.16.44
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Previously, sending a specially crafted message over the control
  channel could cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available
  stack memory, causing :iscman:`named` to terminate unexpectedly.
  This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-3341)

  ISC would like to thank Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-Sec GmbH for
  bringing this vulnerability to our attention. :gl:`#4152`
