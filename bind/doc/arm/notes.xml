	  New quotas have been added to limit the queries that are
	  sent by recursive resolvers to authoritative servers
	  experiencing denial-of-service attacks. When configured,
	  these options can both reduce the harm done to authoritative
	  servers and also avoid the resource exhaustion that can be
	  experienced by recursives when they are being used as a
	  vehicle for such an attack.
	</para>
	<para>
	  NOTE: These options are not available by default; use
	  <command>configure --enable-fetchlimit</command> to include
	  them in the build.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <option>fetches-per-server</option> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent to any single
	      authoritative server.  The configured value is a starting
	      point; it is automatically adjusted downward if the server is
	      partially or completely non-responsive. The algorithm used to
	      adjust the quota can be configured via the
	      <option>fetch-quota-params</option> option.

	  An <command>--enable-querytrace</command> configure switch is
