  <section xml:id="relnotes_license"><info><title>License Change</title></info>
    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with
      or without modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone
      redistributing it without changes. Therefore, this change will be
      without consequence for most individuals and organizations who are
      using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link

      platforms for BIND; "XP" binaries are no longer available for download

	  There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for
	  <command>ms-self</command>, <command>krb5-self</command>,
	  <command>ms-subdomain</command>, and <command>krb5-subdomain</command>
	  rules in <command>update-policy</command> statements.  Though
	  the policies worked as intended, operators who configured their
	  servers according to the misleading documentation may have
	  thought zone updates were more restricted than they were;
	  users of these rule types are advised to review the documentation
	  and correct their configurations if necessary.  New rule types
	  matching the previously documented behavior will be introduced
	  in a future maintenance release. [GL !708]
