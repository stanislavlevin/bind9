    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with
      or without modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone
      redistributing it without changes. Therefore, this change will be
      without consequence for most individuals and organizations who are
      using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND
	  is compiled using <command>configure --with-geoip2</command>.
	  The legacy GeoIP API can be used by compiling with
	  <command>configure --with-geoip</command> instead.  (Note that
	  the databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by
	  MaxMind.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
	  on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
	  for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
	  then the default path will be
	  <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
	  This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
	  using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
	  legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
	  <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
	  no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
	  types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
	  <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
	  <command>as</command>. All of the databases support both IPv4
	  and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added.
	  [GL #605]
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
	  or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
	  address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
	  sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
	  algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated
	  and cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for
	  a DNSSEC validation. [GL #964]

      <listitem>

	  <command>named-checkconf</command> now checks DNS64 prefixes
