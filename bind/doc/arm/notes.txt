License Change

With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open source license
for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).

The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to licensed software
(e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside your organization, that you
publish those changes under that same license. It does not require that
you publish or disclose anything other than the changes you made to our
software.

This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it
without changes. Therefore, this change will be without consequence for
most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.

Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their use of BIND,
or who wish to discuss how to comply with the license may contact ISC at
https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/.

Security Fixes

  * A race condition could trigger an assertion failure when a large
    number of incoming packets were being rejected. This flaw is disclosed
    in CVE-2019-6471. [GL #942]

New Features

  * The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND is compiled
    using configure --with-geoip2. The legacy GeoIP API can be used by
    compiling with configure --with-geoip instead. (Note that the
    databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by MaxMind.)

    The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based on the
    location of the libmaxminddb library; for example, if it is in /usr/
    local/lib, then the default path will be /usr/local/share/GeoIP. This
    value can be overridden in named.conf using the geoip-directory
    option.

    Some geoip ACL settings that were available with legacy GeoIP,
    including searches for netspeed, org, and three-letter ISO country
    codes, will no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2
    database types are country, city, domain, isp, and as. All of the
    databases support both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]

Bug Fixes

  * Glue address records were not being returned in responses to root
    priming queries; this has been corrected. [GL #1092]

End of Life

BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until at least
December, 2021. See https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/
for details of ISC's software support policy.
