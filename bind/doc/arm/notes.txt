License Change

With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open source license
for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).

The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to licensed software
(e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside your organization, that you
publish those changes under that same license. It does not require that
you publish or disclose anything other than the changes you made to our
software.

This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it
without changes. Therefore, this change will be without consequence for
most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.

Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their use of BIND,
or who wish to discuss how to comply with the license may contact ISC at
https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/.

Security Fixes

  * A race condition could trigger an assertion failure when a large
    number of incoming packets were being rejected. This flaw is disclosed
    in CVE-2019-6471. [GL #942]

New Features

  * The new GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported when BIND is compiled
    using configure --with-geoip2. The legacy GeoIP API can be used by
    compiling with configure --with-geoip instead. (Note that the
    databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by MaxMind.)

    The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based on the
    location of the libmaxminddb library; for example, if it is in /usr/
    local/lib, then the default path will be /usr/local/share/GeoIP. This
    value can be overridden in named.conf using the geoip-directory
    option.

    Some geoip ACL settings that were available with legacy GeoIP,
    including searches for netspeed, org, and three-letter ISO country
    codes, will no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2
    database types are country, city, domain, isp, and as. All of the
    databases support both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]

  * A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added.
    [GL #605]

    If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
    or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
    address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
    sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
    algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.

  * DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated and
    cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for a DNSSEC
    validation. [GL #964]

Bug Fixes

  * Glue address records were not being returned in responses to root
    priming queries; this has been corrected. [GL #1092]

  * Interaction between DNS64 and RPZ No Data rule (CNAME *.) could cause
    unexpected results; this has been fixed. [GL #1106]

  * named-checkconf now checks DNS64 prefixes to ensure bits 64-71 are
    zero. [GL #1159]

  * named-checkconf could crash during configuration if configured to use
    "geoip continent" ACLs with legacy GeoIP. [GL #1163]

  * named-checkconf now correctly reports a missing dnstap-output option
    when dnstap is set. [GL #1136]

  * Handle ETIMEDOUT error on connect() with a non-blocking socket. [GL #
    1133]
