          <command>named</command> failed to check the opcode of responses when
          performing zone refreshes, stub zone updates, and UPDATE forwarding.
          This could lead to an assertion failure under certain conditions and
          has been addressed by rejecting responses whose opcode does not match
          the expected value. [GL #2762]
